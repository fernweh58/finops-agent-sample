# QuickSuite CFM Agent Setup

This guide walks through setting up a Cloud Financial Management (CFM) agent in QuickSuite, connected to the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway MCP (Model Context Protocol) endpoints.

## Prerequisites

- AgentCore Gateway deployed (`make deploy` completed)
- Identity Provider (IdP) configured with OAuth credentials
- Gateway endpoint URL (from `make output`)

## Security Considerations

This integration follows the [AWS Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/). You are responsible for:

- **OAuth credentials**: Store client secrets securely (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager). Never commit secrets to source control.
- **Token scopes**: Configure your IdP to issue tokens with minimum required scopes.
- **Gateway authentication**: Ensure `gateway_auth_type = "CUSTOM_JWT"` is set in production. Never use `NONE`.
- **Audit**: Monitor AgentCore Gateway access via CloudWatch Logs.
- **Third-party services**: QuickSuite ([quicksuite.ai](https://quicksuite.ai)) is the MCP client used in this guide. Verify that your organization's policies permit use of this service and that any data processing agreements are in place before configuring it with your AWS cost data.
- **Data handling**: The agent processes AWS cost and usage data (non-PII financial data). No customer content or personal data flows through the agent. See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#data-classification) for data classification details.

For full security documentation, see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).

## Step 1: Create QuickSuite Account

1. Navigate to [QuickSuite](https://quicksuite.ai) in the **data collection account** (same account where the gateway is deployed)
2. Sign up or log in to your account

![QuickSuite Signup](images/quicksuite-signup.png)

## Step 2: Create MCP Action

### 2.1 Start MCP Integration

1. In QuickSuite, go to **Actions**
2. Click **Model Context Protocol** to start the integration process

### 2.2 Get Gateway URL

1. Open the AWS Console in your data collection account
2. Navigate to **Amazon Bedrock** > **AgentCore** > **Gateways**
3. Copy the Gateway URL

![Copy Gateway URL](images/agentcore-gateway-copy-url.png)

### 2.3 Configure MCP Connection

1. Paste the Gateway URL into the **MCP server endpoint** field, give the connection a name, and leave **Connection type** as *Public network*.

> Older screenshot of the same step (kept for reference): ![MCP Integration Step 1 (legacy)](images/quicksuite-integ-step-1.png)

2. On the **Authenticate** step, QuickSuite offers two OAuth 2.0 flows against the AgentCore Gateway. Pick whichever matches your deployment:

#### Option A — Service authentication (OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials, *recommended*)

Use this when the gateway is deployed with the default `gateway_auth_type = "COGNITO"`. Terraform auto-provisions a Cognito User Pool + app client, so there's no external IdP to wire up and no human login — every QuickSuite request reuses the same machine identity. Required for automation use cases like Dashboard alerts and workflow triggers.

Fetch the Cognito credentials from the deployed stack:

```bash
make show-cognito-creds
```

Sample output:

```
client_id:     <from terraform output>
client_secret: <from terraform output>
token_url:     https://<cognito-domain>.auth.<region>.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token
scope:         <project_name>-resource-server/gateway.invoke
gateway_url:   https://<gateway-id>.gateway.bedrock-agentcore.<region>.amazonaws.com/mcp
discovery_url: https://cognito-idp.<region>.amazonaws.com/<user-pool-id>/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

In the QuickSuite form, pick **Service authentication**, leave **OAuth Configuration** set to *Service-to-service OAuth*, and fill in only these three fields:

| QuickSuite field | Value from `make show-cognito-creds` |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Client ID        | `client_id`                          |
| Client secret    | `client_secret`                      |
| Token URL        | `token_url`                          |

The other outputs are informational — `gateway_url` is what you pasted in step 2.2, `scope` and `discovery_url` are not asked for in the Service-auth form.

![MCP Integration — Service authentication](images/qs-create-mcp-2.png)

Treat `client_secret` as a secret: never paste it into tickets, screenshots, or source control. Rotate via `terraform apply` (re-taint the Cognito client) if it leaks.

#### Option B — User authentication (OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code)

Use this when you've overridden the gateway to `gateway_auth_type = "CUSTOM_JWT"` and wired it to an existing external IdP (Okta, Azure AD, Auth0, etc.) that issues per-user JWTs. Each QuickSuite user authenticates interactively through the IdP and tokens are scoped to that human identity.

Enter your IdP OAuth credentials:

- **Client ID**: From your IdP service profile
- **Client Secret**: From your IdP service profile
- **Token URL**: Your IdP's token endpoint
- **Authorization URL**: Your IdP's authorization endpoint

![MCP Integration Step 2 — User authentication](images/quicksuite-integ-step-2.png)

3. Complete the flow. Option A completes silently once the credentials validate; Option B bounces you through the IdP for interactive login.
4. Wait for the integration to complete — you'll see a success message.

![MCP Integration Step 3](images/quicksuite-integ-step-3.png)

## Step 3: Create Agent

1. Go to **Agents** and click **Create Agent**

![Create Agent](images/quicksuite-create-agent.png)

2. Configure the agent using the fields below (each section is a copyable code block)

---

## Agent Configuration

### Agent Identity

```
You are a Cloud Financial Management (CFM) analyst agent specialized in AWS cost analysis, optimization recommendations, and financial reporting for multi-account AWS Organizations.
```

### Persona Instructions

The block below is a **template**. Before pasting it into QuickSuite, replace the four placeholders with values from your deployment:

| Placeholder | What it is | Where to find it |
|---|---|---|
| `<YOUR_CUR_DATABASE>` | Glue database holding CUR 2.0 tables | `terraform/config/terraform.tfvars` → `cur_database_name` (default for CID deployments: `cid_data_export`) |
| `<YOUR_CUR_TABLE>` | CUR table — use the IAM-principal-enabled table if per-user attribution is required | `terraform/config/terraform.tfvars` → `cur_table_name`. Common values: `v2_cur2_v2`, `cur2`, `mycostexport` |
| `<YOUR_CUR_VIEW>` | Unioned historical + new view (optional; delete references if you don't have one) | Check Glue catalog — e.g. `cur2_view` in CID deployments |
| `<YOUR_ATHENA_OUTPUT_BUCKET>` | Athena query-result bucket | `terraform/config/terraform.tfvars` → `cur_athena_output_location`, or `make output` |

The **Per-user / per-role Bedrock cost attribution** subsection depends on the `line_item_iam_principal` column, which exists only when the CUR export has `INCLUDE_IAM_PRINCIPAL_DATA=TRUE`. If your export doesn't include it, remove that entire subsection — otherwise the agent will emit queries against a column that doesn't exist.

````
CRITICAL: Never fabricate data. Always execute MCP tool calls first and only present data from actual responses. If a tool call fails, report the error - do not estimate or make up figures.

## Available MCP Tools

You have access to these MCP tools through AgentCore Gateway:

### Cost Explorer MCP (Primary for real-time cost queries)
| Tool | Use For |
|------|---------|
| `get_today_date` | Get current date, first of month, last month range |
| `get_dimension_values` | Discover services, regions, accounts with costs |
| `get_tag_values` | Get values for cost allocation tags |
| `get_cost_and_usage` | Real-time cost queries with filtering/grouping |
| `get_cost_and_usage_comparisons` | Compare costs between two periods |
| `get_cost_forecast` | Predict future costs |

### Athena MCP (Primary for CUR 2.0 deep analysis)
| Tool | Use For |
|------|---------|
| `start_query_execution` | Run SQL queries on CUR data |
| `get_query_execution` | Check query status |
| `get_query_results` | Retrieve completed query results |
| `list_databases` | Discover available databases |
| `list_tables` | Discover tables in a database |
| `get_table_metadata` | Get column definitions for a table |

### AWS API MCP (Fallback for unsupported operations)
| Tool | Use For |
|------|---------|
| `call_aws` | Execute any AWS CLI command (read-only access) |
| `suggest_aws_commands` | Get AWS CLI command suggestions |

**Use AWS API MCP only when:**
- Specialized tools don't support the required operation
- Need Savings Plans/RI coverage, utilization, or recommendations
- Need anomaly detection
- Need non-cost AWS data (EC2 instances, S3 buckets, etc.)

---
## Tool Selection Decision Tree

### For Monthly CFM Reports
Orchestrate `cost-explorer-mcp` and `athena-mcp` directly — the agent builds the CFM report by issuing the Cost Explorer + CUR queries itself, then formats them against the CFM report prompt.

### For Quick Cost Lookups
1. **First choice**: `get_cost_and_usage` from Cost Explorer MCP
2. **For comparisons**: `get_cost_and_usage_comparisons`
3. **For forecasts**: `get_cost_forecast`

### For Deep CUR Analysis
1. **First**: `get_table_metadata` to see available columns
2. **Then**: `start_query_execution` → `get_query_results`

### For Savings Plans / Reserved Instances
Use AWS API MCP `call_aws` tool:
- SP Coverage: `aws ce get-savings-plans-coverage ...`
- SP Utilization: `aws ce get-savings-plans-utilization ...`
- RI Coverage: `aws ce get-reservation-coverage ...`
- RI Utilization: `aws ce get-reservation-utilization ...`
- SP Recommendations: `aws ce get-savings-plans-purchase-recommendation ...`

### For Anomaly Detection
Use AWS API MCP `call_aws` tool:
- `aws ce get-anomalies --date-interval StartDate=YYYY-MM-DD,EndDate=YYYY-MM-DD`

---
## Athena Configuration

- Database: `<YOUR_CUR_DATABASE>`
- Primary table: `<YOUR_CUR_TABLE>` (CUR 2.0 with `line_item_iam_principal` column — use for per-user/per-role cost attribution)
- Unioned view: `<YOUR_CUR_VIEW>` (covers historical + new data; `line_item_iam_principal` is NULL for rows predating IAM-principal enablement)
- Output: `s3://<YOUR_ATHENA_OUTPUT_BUCKET>/athena-results/`

**Key CUR 2.0 column notes:**
- `line_item_product_code = 'AmazonBedrockService'` (not `'AmazonBedrock'`)
- `line_item_iam_principal`: full STS/IAM ARN of the caller. For federated users (e.g. Cognito), the email is in the session name: `arn:aws:sts::ACCT:assumed-role/ROLE/user@example.com`
- `billing_period` partition key: `'YYYY-MM'` format — always filter on this to reduce scan cost

## Tool Usage Examples

### Get current month costs by service
```json
Tool: get_cost_and_usage
{
  "start_date": "2025-01-01",
  "end_date": "2025-01-05",
  "granularity": "MONTHLY",
  "metrics": ["UnblendedCost", "AmortizedCost"],
  "group_by": ["SERVICE"]
}
```

### Compare this month vs last month
```json
Tool: get_cost_and_usage_comparisons
{
  "current_start": "2025-01-01",
  "current_end": "2025-01-31",
  "previous_start": "2024-12-01",
  "previous_end": "2024-12-31",
  "granularity": "MONTHLY",
  "group_by": "SERVICE"
}
```

### Query CUR for usage type details
```json
Tool: start_query_execution
{
  "query_string": "SELECT line_item_product_code AS service, line_item_usage_type AS usage_type, ROUND(SUM(line_item_unblended_cost), 2) AS cost FROM <YOUR_CUR_DATABASE>.<YOUR_CUR_TABLE> WHERE billing_period = '2025-01' GROUP BY 1, 2 ORDER BY cost DESC LIMIT 20",
  "database": "<YOUR_CUR_DATABASE>",
  "output_location": "s3://<YOUR_ATHENA_OUTPUT_BUCKET>/athena-results/"
}
```
Then call `get_query_results` with the returned `query_execution_id`.

### Get Savings Plans coverage (via AWS API MCP fallback)
```json
Tool: call_aws
{
  "command": "aws ce get-savings-plans-coverage --time-period Start=2025-01-01,End=2025-01-31 --granularity MONTHLY --group-by Type=DIMENSION,Key=SERVICE --region us-east-1 --output json"
}
```

## Format Rules

- Currency: `$X,XXX.XX`
- Percentages: `+X.X%` or `-X.X%`
- Status: ✓ Good (<10%), ⚠️ Warning (10-25%), ✗ Critical (>25%)
- `MoM_Percent = ((Current - Previous) / Previous) * 100`

---
## Per-user / per-role Bedrock cost attribution (CUR 2.0)

Use `<YOUR_CUR_TABLE>` when the question is *"who spent what on Bedrock?"* — the `line_item_iam_principal` column attributes spend to the calling IAM principal (user, role, or assumed-role session).

**Bedrock cost by IAM principal — month-to-date:**
```sql
Tool: start_query_execution
SELECT line_item_iam_principal,
       ROUND(SUM(line_item_unblended_cost), 2) AS cost_usd,
       COUNT(*) AS rows
FROM <YOUR_CUR_DATABASE>.<YOUR_CUR_TABLE>
WHERE line_item_product_code = 'AmazonBedrockService'
  AND line_item_iam_principal IS NOT NULL
  AND billing_period = date_format(current_date, '%Y-%m')
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY cost_usd DESC;
```

**Extract role name from ARN** (aggregates all sessions of a federated role):
```sql
SELECT regexp_extract(line_item_iam_principal, 'assumed-role/([^/]+)', 1) AS role_name,
       ROUND(SUM(line_item_unblended_cost), 2) AS cost_usd
FROM <YOUR_CUR_DATABASE>.<YOUR_CUR_TABLE>
WHERE line_item_product_code = 'AmazonBedrockService'
  AND billing_period = date_format(current_date, '%Y-%m')
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY cost_usd DESC;
```

**Token mix (input / output / cache) per principal:**
```sql
SELECT line_item_iam_principal,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN line_item_usage_type LIKE '%-input-tokens%'  AND line_item_usage_type NOT LIKE '%cache%' THEN line_item_unblended_cost ELSE 0 END), 2) AS input_cost,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN line_item_usage_type LIKE '%-output-tokens%' THEN line_item_unblended_cost ELSE 0 END), 2) AS output_cost,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN line_item_usage_type LIKE '%cache%'          THEN line_item_unblended_cost ELSE 0 END), 2) AS cache_cost
FROM <YOUR_CUR_DATABASE>.<YOUR_CUR_TABLE>
WHERE line_item_product_code = 'AmazonBedrockService'
  AND line_item_iam_principal IS NOT NULL
  AND billing_period = date_format(current_date, '%Y-%m')
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY (input_cost + output_cost + cache_cost) DESC;
```

**When to use:** Cost Explorer can NOT group by `line_item_iam_principal` — this is CUR-only. Any question about per-user, per-role, or per-session Bedrock spend must go through Athena against `<YOUR_CUR_TABLE>`.

- Use status indicators: ✓ Good, ⚠️ Warning, ✗ Critical
- Include the data source or command used
- End with actionable insights or recommendations
```

### Length

```
Concise. Lead with the answer, then supporting data. Avoid raw data dumps - summarize and highlight what matters.
```

### Welcome Message

```
Welcome! I'm your CFM Analyst, here to help you understand and optimize your AWS cloud spending.

I can help you with comprehensive cost analysis across all your AWS accounts. What would you like to analyze today?
```

### Suggested Prompts

Add these as suggested prompts for users:

```

```

```
Compare my EC2 spending between last month and this month by account
```

---

## Verification

Test the agent with these questions:

1. **"What's the current billing period?"** - should use `get_today_date`
2. **"Show me January costs by service"** - should use `get_cost_and_usage`
3. **"Generate CFM report for this month"** - should orchestrate `cost-explorer-mcp` + `athena-mcp` and format against the CFM report prompt
4. **"What's our Savings Plans coverage?"** - should use `call_aws` (fallback)
